**#Scaling Analysis of a Turbomachine Prototype**
This project explores the maximum feasible geometric scaling of a turbomachine prototype (0.2 m length) for testing in a closed-loop, high-pressure flow facility. Using a MATLAB-based framework, flow conditions were propagated across five stations (inlet, compressor, diffuser, test section, outlet), while enforcing facility constraints on pressure, continuity, and Reynolds similarity. The code automated feasibility checks across a compressor map and identified the optimal operating point that enables Mach and Reynolds number similarity.

Key Outcomes:

Maximum achievable scale: 0.62 at inlet stagnation pressure of 204.7 kPa.

Valid scale range: 0.56â€“0.62, ensuring experimental accessibility and reduced cost.

Compressor operating point: 10.55 kg/s mass flow, pressure ratio 1.21, temperature ratio 1.07.

Framework generalizable for turbomachinery scaling studies under facility constraints.
