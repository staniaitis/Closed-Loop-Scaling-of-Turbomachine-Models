# Closed-Loop-Scaling-of-Turbomachine-Models
MATLAB-based framework to determine maximum feasible scaling of a turbomachine prototype in a closed-loop high-pressure facility. Ensures Mach and Reynolds similarity, checks feasibility with compressor maps, and identifies optimal operating point for cost-effective experimental testing.
